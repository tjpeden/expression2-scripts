# Data Signals have been added! These functions allow you to transmit 
# data and execute E2s remotely. Read the wiki for more information.
#
# [wirelink]s can be wired to friends without getting kicked
#
# Expression 2 now uses the friends list of any prop protection
# installed on the server to determine if a player may interact
# with your props and read your code. To allow friends to write to your
# expressions, execute the following: wire_expression2_friendwrite 1
#
# A new operator [A ?: B] has been added, shortcut for [A ? A : B]
# Example: Output = A ?: B, Output = A ?: B ?: C
#
# Functionality for checking if inputs are connected is now available
# Example: if (->Input) { ... }
